"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I had a really difficult time completing every lab that had an excel component. The reason for this is that most of the instructions, seemingly detailed to students without online tasks and computer skills, was very lacking in detail to someone like myself. I was late doing almost every single lab, and penalized for it, when I should not have been, as the time to complete it along with all other courses was too much to ask. On average, I had to spend between 18-30 hours to finish every lab. My mark suffered as a result",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714
"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I have been using excel for awhile with programming so i have been pretty comfy with it, but I think it could be really helpful to someone newer with excel",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714
"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I really enjoyed it! It was interesting and really did help me with excel, but was also a cool glimpse into environmental chemistry. I feel like it was one of the few real world/career-type applications of class content we got in this class.",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714

"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I think it would be better if there is an instruction video made by TA. When I took another course, the TA made a short video, which was about 3 minutes, that showed procedures of making a graph and slight tip for the interpretation. This actually made the students have less questions regarding the lab assignment.",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714
"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I think that it's not really fair that even if students had successfully uploaded photos and scans on their end and their TA's were not able to access it, there would be marks off. On top of that, only some students were allowed to have their labs regraded because of that while others did not get the opportunity or were not allowed to. It is completely out of the students control about whether or not something had been uploaded properly after they have checked on their end and I believe that the marking team should be more fair in letting every student have the chance the redeem themselves since they did all the hard work on their end",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714
"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know?

"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"Some aspects of the excel tipsheet were written as if the reader had prior knowledge of Excel, eg referring to 'copying' without specifying that in Excel this isn't the same as the copy of copy/paste function. The tipsheet also did not account for differences in versions of Excel or for how it presents on different devices, e.g. I had to try 3 different makes/ages of computer to get the proper date format option. Other students may not have the option of switching devices. After the initial learning curve it was a very helpful resource and much appreciated!",1,"Apr. 2021",14,7.14285714285714

"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"(1) I really enjoyed all of the labs. (2) I consistently underestimated the time required to complete the labs - but maybe I am simply slow. (3) I think it would be useful for the professor to spend five to ten minutes introducing each lab. What are the learning objectives?",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"all labs had very clear instructions except for lab#4, the instructions were not clear and were not easy to follow.",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"Having more hands on labs will make it easier to learn the material",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I feel like we shouldn't have to do this much excel alone prior to labs. I believe it would be highly beneficial to have 3 hours labs as normal, with mandatory attendance. Make lab sections that vary in time, aka early in the day, mid day, and evening, so people in all time zones can attend, but still have mandatory attendance. It doesn't feel like I did one lab the entire semester. I just feel like a professional data entry specialist. Other than that, the actual classes were fine, and all of the professors seemed to care about concerns.",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I found that they complemented the course material very well and actually helped prepare me for the tests.",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I know this might be unavoidable because of online courses but at times I felt that the majority of material for the labs were more tedious than educational.  For instance, most of the time I spent on some of the labs was for filling in Excel spreadsheets rather than practicing calculations and gaining a better understanding of the material.  Again though, I know that this is probably difficult to reform because of CHM135 being online but I thought I would mention it nevertheless.  Besides that I thought the labs were fine :)",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I loved all of them except the first one. I especially enjoyed the last two. Thank you!",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I thought they were really effective. I honestly feel like the excel and data analysis skills I developed were more useful to me as a science student than doing the actual wet lab work, like titrations. Obviously that stuff is important too, but it can be learned easily and isn't applicable in many other classes beyond chem. Using excel, reading trendlines, and working through methodical steps to solve an end problem are applicable skills I can use in any class.",1,"Apr. 2021",15,6.66666666666667
"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I was very intimidated by the idea of labs, but the straightforward nature of the assignments plus having an excellent lab TA made it one of my favourite parts of the course.

"Is there anything that you would like to share about the CHM135 labs overall?",5,"I would REALLY have appreciated a full set of the instructions in a PDF in the same way we were able to download a PDF of the report to work on.

"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"Doing a lab based on information we organize from excel is no different than giving us a graph and a table and asking us to identify information, it just takes longer to organize it on excel.

"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know? Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"having a video tutorial with excel would have been very useful, so that we can refer back to it if we don't remember certain aspects of working on Excel.

Both positive feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.",1,"I can recall that my TA went through the lab really quickly, but then again it is hard to follow along when switching back and forth between Zoom and Excel all the time. The recorded Lab 1 session was extremely helpful though! The TA took the time to explain every aspect of the lab which was very nice (plus I could pause it at any time).",1,"Nov. 2021",328,0.304878048780488
"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know?

"Any additional feedback on Lab 1 that you would like the teaching team to know?

That should not be needed as instructions should have been more orgnaized and straightforward. Moreover, the TAs who host the live labs sessions do not go over what the lab entails rather they teach a concept that was already taught in the lectures.
