I try not to get behind, but when you dont know the material it can be hard to contribute and that could be why people can stay silent.

Not everyone is rich. Not everyone has free time. People might have to work to support their families. I have worked so hard but the questions are too hard with not enough time. I have cried everyday and not one day have my mental health been stable. I am a very studious students and just because part of the class did better on the test doesn't mean everyone learn the same way. You say to take care of mental health but where do I get the time. I am either studying, working to support my family or crying over this. UofT didn't teach me to dream bigger, it taught me to dream smaller and only the smartest people will make it out, and I am not smart. I have to work hard to get good grades and I have always worked hard but UoFT don't want hard workers, they want smart people. I regret my decisions to UoFT everyday but UoFT is not going to stop me from going to med school because you haven't met my God yet. 

Please reconsider this for next year, I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I go through. I am saying this in the nicest and calmest way possible for you to get a glimpse into the life of students. I do not have a pHD in Chem, so it will naturally take more time for me to complete the questions than it would for you.

I felt more confident in my answers after the 2nd test - but there is something about having to think on the spot / apply the material in a different way that I enjoy on an exam).

I feel like the class slides are too much oriented towards someone who has an iPad device and it's longer and more grueling for someone to write it all out by hand as it's too much to print especially with all the diagrams and whatnot. It lies heavy on the assumption that someone has a device to which they can follow along but that's not necessarily or a printer with enough ink to consume it all. And it would be more helpful if more problems that are more complicated would be walked through as well as a detailed explanation of the practice tests as that's really the only application to really work through and apply the content and it has less to do with memorizing but recognizing how to process and apply.,,,"Yes, I feel much more confident using Excel",,,"Yes, I feel more confident",,,"No, I don't feel the Excel component of Lab 1 helped me complete the Excel components of the other CHM135 labs",,,,,
