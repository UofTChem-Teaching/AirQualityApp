<h3>Data Sources</h3>

The air quality data is taken from Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Program. The displayed data is a combination of hourly O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> measurements from 2020; it can be found freely at the NAPS Data repository <a href="http://data.ec.gc.ca/data/air/monitor/national-air-pollution-surveillance-naps-program/Data-Donnees/?lang=en">here</a>. Hourly Odd O<sub>x</sub> measurements calculated by summing O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at the same hour.

Population data was assembled from the <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E">2016 Canadian Census Profile</a> or Wikipedia when otherwise unavailable. Classification of population size based on Statistics Canada's <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/pcrac/2016/introduction">Population Centre and Rural Area Classification 2016</a>. Briefly: 
 <ul>
  <li><b>large</b> urban population centres, consist of a population of 100,000 and over</li>
  <li><b>medium</b> population centres, have a population of between 30,000 and 99,999</li>
  <li><b>small</b> population centres, have a population of between 1,000 and 29,999</li> 
  <li><b>rural</b> population centres, have a population below 1,000</li>
</ul>
