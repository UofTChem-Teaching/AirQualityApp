<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p> As part of Experiment 1, you'll analyze a small subset of ECCC NAPS data, which will be provided to you under the <b>My Date</b> tab. To explore the entirety of  O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> measurements recorded by the NAPS network across Canada in 2020 see the <b>Explore NAPS</b> tab.</p>

<h3> How to navigate the website</h3>

<p>  This website is broken into six parts: the side panel and the five tabs at the top of the page.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>The <b> side panel</b> is where you'll find all available NAPS stations for plotting (click on a marker for station details); a dropdown menu to select the station, the date range you'd like to explore, and options to modify the plots (see Explore NAPS tab). </li>
  <li><b>Welcome</b> tab, what you're reading right now.</li>
  <li><b>My Data</b> tab, where you'll input your student number and get your NAPS data subset for the CHM135 Lab 1 work.</li>
  <li><b>Explore NAPS</b> tab which contains the time series and O<sub>3</sub> vs. NO<sub>2</sub> correlation plots. The side panel options modify these plots.</li>
  <li><b>Summary stats</b> tab which displays some simple summary stats of the selected data; this is the same data shown in the Plots tab</li>
  <li><b>Notes</b> tab with sources on data.</li>
</ul>
