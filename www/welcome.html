<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p> As part of Experiment 1, you've already analyzed a small subset of the ECCC NAPS data. To see the rest, we've created this website where you're able to explore all of the O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> measurements recorded by the NAPS network across Canada in 2018.</p>

<h3> How to navigate the website</h3>

<p>  This website is broken into five parts: the side panel and the four tabs at the top of the page.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>The <b> side panel</b> is where you can see find all available NAPS stations (click on a marker for station details); a dropdown menu to select the station and date range you'd like to explore and options to modify the plots (see Plots tab). </li>
  <li><b>Welcome tab</b>, what you're reading right now.</li>
  <li><b>Plots tab</b>, which contains the time series and O<sub>3</sub> vs. NO<sub>2</sub> correlation plots. The side panel options modify these plots.</li>
  <li><b>Summary stats tab</b> which displays some simple summary stats of the selected data; this is the same data shown in the Plots tab</li>
  <li><b>Notes tab</b> with sources on data.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>This website is a bit of an experiment for the CHM135 course. If you found it useful/interesting (or not!), please let us know during your course evaluations later on in the term. </p>
